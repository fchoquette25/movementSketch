One thing that was challenging for me during this process was just getting the code started. I had been a bit confused after last times class, so starting fresh a couple days later proved to be a challenge. I wasn't entirely sure where to start so I went back and reviewed the code that you had shown in class, and the previous assignment that I had submitted to get some ideas. One thing that makes more sense than it did before is how to move the sketch around the screen. I wasn't entirely sure how to do that before and now it makes sense. Additionally, I was able to learn how to make it bounce off the sides of the screen so that it continues moving around in a loop. In reality, I am most proud of doing the entire sketch, as I was pretty confused at first. But if I had to pick, I am once again, most proud of figuring out how to make it bounce off the walls. I think that was pretty cool.
